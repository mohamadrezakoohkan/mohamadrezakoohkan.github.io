# Blog Writing Rule

## 1. Evolutionary Content Philosophy

Every blog post is a living organism, not a finished product. Follow these four pillars:

### Primordial Soup
Early posts establish ancestral DNA. Don't aim for authority; aim for a viable genetic base. Each post should plant a trait -- a theme, opinion, or technical insight -- that future content can inherit and evolve from.

### Minimum Evolvable Product
Posts are lungfish, not final forms. Ship ideas fast. Leave room for mutation. A post that sparks unexpected traction is a signal to evolve toward, not a fluke. Don't over-polish; publish and let the environment respond.

### Environmental Selection
Readers are selective pressure, not an audience to please. Low traffic is not failure; it's pre-selection. Double down on traits the environment feeds with attention. Let engagement data guide which themes survive.

### Adaptation via Iteration
The blog is a living organism. Features, formats, and recurring themes are adaptations that emerge, not features that are planned. Revisit old posts as ancestors -- reference them, build on them, let ideas branch.

## 2. Writing Voice & Tone

Reza is an iOS Engineer since 2016 who has shipped more than 10,000 releases. Write accordingly:

- **Practitioner-first**: Write from real shipping experience, not academic authority. "In my experience shipping X..." beats "Studies show..."
- **Sharp-colleague tone**: Conversational but technically credible -- like explaining something to a senior engineer over coffee
- **Opinionated when warranted**: Take a stance. Cite real-world shipping experience as evidence. Don't hedge with "I think maybe..." -- prefer direct, confident statements
- **No fluff**: Get to the point. The retro blog personality is concise and content-first. Every paragraph should earn its place
- **Avoid tutorial voice**: This is not a step-by-step guide site. Share insights, observations, and opinions -- not "How to do X in 5 easy steps"

## 3. Post Format & Technical Requirements

All posts live in `data/posts.json` as objects in the `posts` array. **Never create standalone HTML files for post content.**

### JSON Schema

```json
{
  "id": "kebab-case-slug",
  "title": "Post Title Here",
  "date": "Month Day, Year",
  "excerpt": "1-2 sentence hook. Compelling enough to survive environmental selection.",
  "url": "posts/post.html?id=kebab-case-slug",
  "content": [
    "First paragraph as a string.",
    "═══ SECTION HEADING ═══",
    "Paragraph under the heading.",
    "• Bullet point using the bullet character",
    "• Another bullet point",
    "Final paragraph."
  ]
}
```

### Field Rules

- **id**: Unique, kebab-cased. Check existing posts to avoid collisions
- **title**: Clear and direct. No clickbait
- **date**: Format is `"Month Day, Year"` (e.g., `"February 5, 2026"`)
- **excerpt**: 1-2 sentences max -- the "hook" that appears in the post listing
- **url**: Always follows pattern `posts/post.html?id={id}`
- **content**: Array of strings, each representing a paragraph or element:
  - Regular paragraphs: plain strings
  - Headings: `═══ HEADING TEXT ═══` (triple box-drawing equals signs)
  - Bullet points: `• ` prefix (bullet character, not hyphen)

### Ordering

New posts go at the **top** of the `posts` array (index 0). Newest first.

## 4. Content Checklist (Pre-Ship)

Before finalizing any post, verify every item:

- [ ] **Ancestral trait planted**: The post contains at least one theme, opinion, or technical insight that future posts can reference or build on
- [ ] **Excerpt survives selection**: The excerpt is compelling and specific -- not generic filler
- [ ] **Practitioner tone**: The voice is experience-driven, not tutorial-driven
- [ ] **JSON schema matches**: All required fields present (`id`, `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, `url`, `content`)
- [ ] **id is unique**: No collision with existing post IDs in the array
- [ ] **id is kebab-cased**: Lowercase, hyphen-separated
- [ ] **date format correct**: Uses `"Month Day, Year"` format
- [ ] **url pattern correct**: Matches `posts/post.html?id={id}`
- [ ] **content array valid**: Each element is a string; headings use `═══` format; bullets use `•`
- [ ] **New post is first**: Inserted at index 0 of the `posts` array
